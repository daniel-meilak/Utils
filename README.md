### C++ Utilities

These C++ files were created during various Advent of Code events, with the aim of simplifying input parsing or providing functions for common tasks.

The Utils.h and Utils.cpp form the bulk of this repository, containing functions for input parsing of different types.

point.h offers a simple 2D point structure as well as various functions for comparison, hashing and distance calculations.

The math_func.cpp file offers implementations of various algorithms, often adjusted from those on [Rosetta Code](www.rosettacode.org).
