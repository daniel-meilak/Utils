### C++ Utilities

These C++ files were created during various Advent of Code events, with the aim of simplifying input parsing or providing functions for common tasks.

The Utils.h and Utils.cpp form the bulk of this repository, containing functions for input parsing of different types.

The math_func.cpp file offers implementations of various algorithms, often adjusted from those on [Rosetta Code](www.rosettacode.org).

Finally, intcode.h and intcode.cpp offers an implementation of a virtual machine CPU used in Advent of Code 2019.

TO DO:
- resolve manhattan functions into one
- create templates for input digesting functions
- remove intcode.
- decide if math_func should be incorporated into Utils
